[WakaTime][wakatime] is an open source VS Code plugin for metrics, insights, and time tracking automatically generated from your programming activity.

[Arduino IDE](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide) `2.x` has been entirely rewritten and share no code with `1.x`. The new IDE is based on [Theia IDE](https://theia-ide.org/) framework and build with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). It natively supports VSCODE extensions so we can use [WakaTime VSCODE](https://github.com/wakatime/vscode-wakatime) extension to track your coding time.

## Installation

Unfortunately there's no native way to install VSCODE extensions in Arduino IDE so far. So we have to install it manually.

1. Download the latest vscode-wakatime plugin vsix from [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/extension/WakaTime/vscode-wakatime).
2. Rename the `.vsix` file to `.zip`.
3. Extract the zip file into `~/.arduinoIDE/plugins/vscode-wakatime`.
4. Relaunch your Arduino IDE.
5. Enter your [api key](https://wakatime.com/api-key), then press enter.
    > (If you’re not prompted, press `F1` or `⌘ + Shift + P` then type `WakaTime API Key`.)
6. Use Arduino IDE like you normally do and your coding activity will be displayed on your [WakaTime Dashboard](https://wakatime.com/).

## Usage

Visit [https://wakatime.com](https://wakatime.com) to see your coding activity.

## Configuring

VS Code specific settings are available from `⌘ + Shift + P`, then typing `wakatime`.

For example, to hide today's coding activity in your status bar:

Press `⌘ + Shift + P` then set `WakaTime: Status Bar Coding Activity` to `false`.

Extension settings are stored in the INI file at `$WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime.cfg`.

More information can be found from [wakatime-cli][wakatime-cli configs].

Notes:

1. `$WAKATIME_HOME` defaults to `$HOME`
1. To disable the extension at startup add `disabled=true` to your config, this operation can also be performed by pressing `⌘ + Shift + P` and selecting `WakaTime: Disable`.

## Troubleshooting

First, turn on debug mode:

1. Press `F1` or `⌘ + Shift + P`
2. Type `> WakaTime: Debug`, and press `Enter`.
3. Select `true`, then press `Enter`.

Next, open your Developer Console to view logs and errors:

`Help → Toggle Developer Tools`

Errors outside the scope of vscode-wakatime go to `$WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime.log` from [wakatime-cli][wakatime-cli help].

The [How to Debug Plugins][how to debug] guide shows how to check when coding activity was last received from your editor using the [Plugins Status Page][plugins status page].

**Microsoft Windows Only:** Using WakaTime behind a corporate proxy? Try enabling your Windows Root Certs inside VS Code with the [win-ca][winca] extension:
Press `Ctrl + Shift + X`, search for `win-ca`, press `Install`.

For more general troubleshooting info, see the [wakatime-cli Troubleshooting Section][wakatime-cli help].

## Uninstalling

1. Delete folder `~/.arduinoIDE/plugins/vscode-wakatime`.
